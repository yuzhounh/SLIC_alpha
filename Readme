SLIC: a whole brain parcellation toolbox
Copyright (C) 2016 Jing Wang

The SLIC toolbox contains five whole brain parcellation approaches that 
operates on resting-state fMRI data. Three of them are reproduced from the 
Ncut-based approaches in (Craddock et al., 2012, HBM) and (Shen et al., 
2013, Neuroimage). The remaining two are the mean SLIC and two-level SLIC 
approaches that integrate Ncut and SLIC. The release includes the Matlab 
scripts and the whole brain atlases. A paper on this project is under 
submission.

This toolbox is also shared on NITRC (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/slic/). 

Usage:
The current toolbox contains the major source codes, which should be
customized before running on a specific fMRI dataset. Interested readers 
can refer to parc_main.m for the processing procedure.
